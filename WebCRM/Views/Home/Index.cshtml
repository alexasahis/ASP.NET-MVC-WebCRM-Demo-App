    <h1>WebCRM Demo App</h1>
    <p class="lead">
    <p>A basic HTML-only CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) example using ASP.Net, MVC 5, Entity Framework 6 and contains the
    following modules:
    <ul>
        
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Companies", "Index", "Companies", new { }, new { })</li>
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Contacts", "Index", "Contacts", new { }, new { })</li>
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Activities", "Index", "ActivityHistories", new { }, new { })</li>
    </ul>
    The @Html.ActionLink("About", "About") page describes some of the MVC / EntityFramework / Javascript functionality
    used to build this small web app.

        This application is intended solely for the purposes of exploring the MS MVC and EntityFramework.
        This version was built with Visual Studio 2013 using MVC5, EntityFramework 6, and SQL Server LocalDB for data
        storage.  There's really nothing fancy going on in terms of user interface / experience.  Mostly HTML with some
        AJAX calls thrown in on the front-end and MVC / EF on the server.  Feel free to download, cut it up, use parts 
        of it in any way desired.
